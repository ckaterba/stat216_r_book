# Inferential statistics, take 2

This chapter will show you how to calculate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests using R's in-built hypothesis testing functions. We will quickly go over the same examples from the previous sections using R's functions to recover the values we calculated earlier. 


## Analyzing categorical variables

### Single sample proportions

The main function we will use in this section is `prop.test(...)`; it both calculates confidence intervals *and* performs hypothesis tests all in one fell swoop! The important thing for us, then, is being able to read and interpret the outputs. 



### Two sample proportions

The main function we will use in this section is again `prop.test(...)`; it's a workhorse!

### Chi-squared goodness of fit test

### Chi-squared test of independence

## Analyzing numerical variables 

### Single sample mean

### Two sample mean

### Paired data

### Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
