This book aims to introduce you to all of the features youll need to use in R to be successful in the course. Moreover, we hope that it will help you develop the tools you need to use R in your future endeavors. This book is by no means a complete guide to everything one can do in R, but the aim is to cut down on content and theory in the name of practicality. This class will provide many students with their first interaction with computer programming. The coding required is not extensive and the coding-based activities are heavily scaffolded. The point of including R in this course is not to introduce another layer of difficulty; the opposite is true in fact! The goal is to give you a glimpse at how programming can make your life easier, at least when it comes to statistics and data science. In the process, you will hopefully add another useful and practical tool to your tool belt. Computers are not exiting our lives any time soon and being somewhat familiar with a little programming will only be an advantage. Some might say such familiarity will become essential. 1.1 Organization The chapters of this book will be organized to follow the flow of STAT216 so that reading the book sequentially teaches you the tools as you need them in class. This book will almost certainly be a work in progress, so if theres something that youd like to see or if you think something is missing, dont hesitate to reach out to the author (or your instructor if they are different people). 1.2 Getting started Using R and R Studio. 1.3 Debugging In this class, you will very likely come to a point where some code youve written will not run. This experience can be very frustrating. Remember, it happens to everyone and it frustrates everyone. Hadley Wickham provides a a detailed guide on how to debug code in this book Advanced R, but here is my take with a few additions. Double and triple check your syntax. New coders are often stymied by small syntax mistakes. For instance, if you want to use a function called f in R, but you type F instead, the machine wont do the right thing. Similarly, be careful about commas; for example, elements of lists need to be separated by commas and they can be easy to forget. There are a too many syntax errors one can make to list here. Search the internet for the error codes youre seeing. You can simply copy and paste them into your web browser. Most likely someone before you has made the same mistake and asked the same question. Figure out exactly where the error is. This is harder than it seems like it should be sometimes. In short pieces of code it is usually easy to identify, but when you become more advanced and write longer code the problem can get tricky. Reach out to your instructor and/or the STEM tutoring center at FVCC. These people are invaluable resources. Be sure to not only share the error code, but the entire chunk of code that you think is problematic. Even better, share all of your code. The website CrossValidated is a stack exchange where users can ask and answers questions about statistics, especially R coding. You may be able to get questions answered here, but be warned: the community is very picky about how you ask questions and about the type of questions you ask. 1.4 Code chunks in this book You should be able to copy and paste all code chunks in this book into your own RStudio terminal and reproduce the results you see in the book. All data used in this book will be sourced from base R or other commonly used packages. The author will endeavor to be clear about what packages are loaded and where data sets are coming from throughout the book. "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. "],["cross.html", "Chapter 3 Cross-references 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 3.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 3 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
