## Summary statistics in R

## Data visualization

There are three main ways to create plots in R: base R, `lattice`, and `ggplot2`.  We will only learn about base R and `ggplot2` in this course.  In practice, I use base R to make graphs quickly to get an idea of what's going on and `ggplot2` to make more visually appealing and complicated graphics.
